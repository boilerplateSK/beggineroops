## Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a powerful programming paradigm that organizes programs around "objects" - self-contained units that bundle both data and the behaviors that operate on that data. This approach is particularly effective for modeling real-world entities and their relationships, leading to more organized, reusable, and scalable codebases.

### Why Learn OOP in Python?

- **Structured Complexity Management**: Handle larger projects with modular, organized code
- **Code Reusability**: Define functionalities once and apply them across various parts of your application
- **Python Foundation**: Understanding OOP is crucial since virtually everything in Python is treated as an object
- **Maintainable Software**: Build robust, scalable systems that are easier to debug and extend

## Core OOP Concepts

### Classes: The Blueprints

A class serves as a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure, attributes, and methods that all objects created from that class will possess.

```python
class Dog:
    species = "Canine"  # Class attribute
    
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name    # Instance attribute
        self.age = age      # Instance attribute
    
    def bark(self):
        print(f"{self.name} says Woof!")
```

### Objects: The Real Deal

An object is a concrete instance created from a class blueprint. Each object is unique with its own specific data while sharing behaviors defined by its class.

```python
# Creating objects (instantiation)
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)
your_dog = Dog("Lucy", 5)

# Each object has unique data
print(f"{my_dog.name} is {my_dog.age} years old")
my_dog.bark()  # Output: Buddy says Woof!
```

### Methods and the `self` Parameter

Methods are functions defined inside a class that describe what objects can do. The `self` parameter refers to the instance calling the method and must be the first parameter in instance methods.

### The `__init__` Method

The `__init__` method (constructor) is automatically called when creating a new object. It initializes the object's instance attributes with provided values.

## The Four Pillars of OOP

### 1. Encapsulation: Keeping Things Tidy and Safe

Encapsulation bundles data and methods into a single unit while controlling access to an object's internal state.

**Python Access Conventions:**
- **Public**: `attribute` - Accessible from anywhere
- **Protected**: `_attribute` - Intended for internal use (convention)
- **Private**: `__attribute` - Name mangling applied (discouraged external access)

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute
    
    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.__balance += amount
    
    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance
```

### 2. Inheritance: Building on What's Already There

Inheritance allows a new class to acquire properties and behaviors from an existing class, promoting code reusability.

```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Animal makes a sound.")

class Dog(Animal):  # Dog inherits from Animal
    def speak(self):  # Method overriding
        print("Bark bark!")

my_dog = Dog()
my_dog.speak()  # Output: Bark bark!
```

### 3. Polymorphism: Many Forms, One Interface

Polymorphism allows a single interface to represent different types, enabling flexible and adaptable code.

```python
class Shape:
    def calculate_area(self):
        pass

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius
    
    def calculate_area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius

class Square(Shape):
    def __init__(self, side):
        self.side = side
    
    def calculate_area(self):
        return self.side * self.side

# Same method call, different behavior
shapes = [Circle(5), Square(4)]
for shape in shapes:
    print(f"Area: {shape.calculate_area()}")
```

**Duck Typing**: Python's flexibility allows objects to be suitable for a purpose based on their capabilities rather than their explicit type.

### 4. Abstraction: Hiding Complexity

Abstraction simplifies complex systems by showing only essential functionality while hiding implementation details.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius
    
    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius

# Cannot instantiate abstract class directly
# shape = Shape()  # This would raise TypeError
circle = Circle(5)
print(f"Area: {circle.area()}")
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic Python knowledge (variables, functions, control structures)
- Python 3.x installed on your system

### Quick Start Example

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
        self.is_running = False
    
    def start_engine(self):
        if not self.is_running:
            self.is_running = True
            print(f"The {self.year} {self.make} {self.model} is now running!")
        else:
            print("Engine is already running.")
    
    def stop_engine(self):
        if self.is_running:
            self.is_running = False
            print("Engine stopped.")
        else:
            print("Engine is already off.")

# Create and use a car object
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2020)
my_car.start_engine()  # Output: The 2020 Toyota Camry is now running!
my_car.stop_engine()   # Output: Engine stopped.
```

## Examples

### Basic Class Structure

```python
class Student:
    school_name = "Python Academy"  # Class attribute
    
    def __init__(self, name, grade):
        self.name = name        # Instance attribute
        self.grade = grade      # Instance attribute
        self.courses = []       # Instance attribute
    
    def enroll_course(self, course):
        self.courses.append(course)
        print(f"{self.name} enrolled in {course}")
    
    def display_info(self):
        print(f"Student: {self.name}")
        print(f"Grade: {self.grade}")
        print(f"School: {self.school_name}")
        print(f"Courses: {', '.join(self.courses) if self.courses else 'None'}")

# Usage
student1 = Student("Alice", 10)
student1.enroll_course("Mathematics")
student1.enroll_course("Physics")
student1.display_info()
```

### Inheritance Example

```python
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, make, model):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
    
    def display_info(self):
        print(f"Vehicle: {self.make} {self.model}")

class Car(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, make, model, doors):
        super().__init__(make, model)  # Call parent constructor
        self.doors = doors
    
    def display_info(self):
        super().display_info()  # Call parent method
        print(f"Doors: {self.doors}")

class Motorcycle(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, make, model, engine_size):
        super().__init__(make, model)
        self.engine_size = engine_size
    
    def display_info(self):
        super().display_info()
        print(f"Engine: {self.engine_size}cc")

# Usage
car = Car("Honda", "Civic", 4)
bike = Motorcycle("Yamaha", "R1", 1000)

car.display_info()
bike.display_info()
```

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions
- **Classes**: Use PascalCase (`MyClass`, `BankAccount`)
- **Methods and Attributes**: Use snake_case (`my_method`, `account_balance`)
- **Constants**: Use UPPER_CASE (`MAX_SPEED`, `DEFAULT_COLOR`)

### Documentation
```python
class Rectangle:
    """A class representing a rectangle shape.
    
    Attributes:
        width (float): The width of the rectangle
        height (float): The height of the rectangle
    """
    
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        """Initialize a rectangle with given width and height.
        
        Args:
            width (float): The width of the rectangle
            height (float): The height of the rectangle
        """
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
    
    def area(self):
        """Calculate and return the area of the rectangle.
        
        Returns:
            float: The area of the rectangle
        """
        return self.width * self.height
```

### General Guidelines
- Keep classes focused on a single responsibility
- Use meaningful names for classes, methods, and attributes
- Favor composition over inheritance when appropriate
- Write docstrings for your classes and methods
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Use Python's naming conventions for access control
